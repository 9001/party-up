Send files and links to a <a href="https://github.com/9001/copyparty">copyparty</a> server by sharing them to this app

<b>Features:</b><ul>
<li>sha512-verified uploads</li>
<li>stash links and plaintext</li>
<li>supports HTTP and HTTPS</li></ul>

<b>Future ideas:</b><ul>
<li>upload slicing (resumable + usually faster)</li>
<li>display/copy link to the uploaded files</li></ul>

This can be used to turn a raspi into a very flexible chromecast clone; see <a href="https://github.com/9001/party-up">the readme</a> for details
