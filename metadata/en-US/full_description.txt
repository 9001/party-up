Send files and links to a <a href="https://github.com/9001/copyparty">copyparty</a> server by sharing them to this app

<b>Features:</b>
• sha512-verified uploads
• stash links and plaintext
• display/copy link to the uploaded files
• supports HTTP and HTTPS

<b>Future ideas:</b>
• upload slicing (resumable + usually faster)

This can be used to turn a raspi into a very flexible chromecast clone; see <a href="https://github.com/9001/party-up">the readme</a> for details
